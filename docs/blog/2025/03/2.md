## Direct assignment

Object reference

```python
In [1]: a = {1: [1,2,3]}

In [2]: b=a

In [3]: a[0]=[1,1]

In [4]: b
Out[4]: {1: [1, 2, 3], 0: [1, 1]}
```

## Copy

Copying the parent object does not copy the child object inside the object

```python
In [5]: a = {1: [1,2,3]}

In [6]: b = a.copy()

In [7]: a, b
Out[7]: ({1: [1, 2, 3]}, {1: [1, 2, 3]})

In [8]: a[1].append(4)

In [9]: a, b
Out[9]: ({1: [1, 2, 3, 4]}, {1: [1, 2, 3, 4]})
```

## Deep Copy

The parent object and its child objects are completely copied

```python
In [10]: import copy

In [11]: c = copy.deepcopy(a)

In [12]: a, c
Out[12]: ({1: [1, 2, 3, 4]}, {1: [1, 2, 3, 4]})

In [13]: a[1].append(5)

In [14]: a, c
Out[14]: ({1: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]}, {1: [1, 2, 3, 4]})
```
